# FutarchyDAO: A Governance Framework Powered by FHE

FutarchyDAO is a pioneering governance framework utilizing Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to transform decision-making within decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). By leveraging encrypted prediction markets, this innovative mechanism shifts the paradigm of governance from direct voting to a more informed and rational process that is driven by the potential outcomes of proposals. 

## The Governance Dilemma

Traditional voting methods can often lead to decisions that reflect popular opinion rather than rational analysis. This frequently results in governance outcomes that may not align with the long-term goals of the DAO. In scenarios where complex proposals are presented, the ability to forecast their outcomes is crucial. However, conventional methods lack the privacy and accuracy needed to effectively assess the true impact of governance decisions, leading to suboptimal outcomes and missed opportunities.

## The FHE Advantage

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows us to compute on encrypted data without ever revealing its content. This aspect is vital for FutarchyDAO, as it enables the creation of a prediction market that is both private and secure. Implemented using Zama's open-source libraries, including the **Concrete** SDK, FutarchyDAO ensures that governance proposals are evaluated based on objective market predictions rather than subjective votes. This mechanism enhances decision-making by promoting a results-oriented approach that is backed by cryptographic guarantees.

## Key Features

- **Encrypted Prediction Markets:** Utilize encrypted mechanisms to assess the feasibility and outcomes of proposals without compromising participant privacy.
- **Rational Decision-Making:** Shift from populist voting to informed governance that prioritizes achieving the DAO's objectives.
- **Game Theory Integration:** The framework is designed to incorporate elements of game theory, encouraging rational behavior among participants.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface for governance proposals and related prediction market interactions.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK (Concrete, TFHE-rs)**
- **Solidity** for smart contract development
- **Node.js** for server-side logic
- **Hardhat** for Ethereum development environment

## Project Structure

The directory structure for the FutarchyDAO project is as follows:

```
/FutarchyDAO
│
├── contracts
│   └── futarchyDAO_FHE.sol
│
├── scripts
│   └── deploy.js
│
├── test
│   └── futarchyDAO_FHE_test.js
│
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Installation Guide

To set up the FutarchyDAO on your local machine, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
2. **Hardhat** (for developing Ethereum smart contracts)

Once dependencies are in place, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the command below to install the required packages, including the Zama FHE libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

**Important:** Do not use `git clone` or any URL commands as part of your installation process.

## Build & Run Guide

After installing the necessary packages, you can compile, test, and deploy the FutarchyDAO smart contract using the following commands:

1. **Compile the contracts:**

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:**

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

3. **Deploy the contract to a local Ethereum network:**

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

4. **Interact with the smart contract:**
   You can create governance proposals and view prediction market outcomes via the user interface connected to your local setup.

## Example of Creating a Governance Proposal

Here’s a simple example of how to create a governance proposal using the FutarchyDAO interface:

```javascript
const FutarchyDAO = artifacts.require("futarchyDAO_FHE");

async function createProposal(proposalDescription) {
    const instance = await FutarchyDAO.deployed();
    const result = await instance.createProposal(proposalDescription);
    console.log(`Proposal created with ID: ${result.toString()}`);
}
```

By calling `createProposal` with a relevant description, you can initiate a new governance proposal within the DAO framework.
